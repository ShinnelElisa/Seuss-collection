# Seuss-collection
This react application mimics a virtual book self.
It functions as a rolodex showing the number of available copies of Dr. Seuss books. 
Users may utilize the “search collection” button included towards the top of the page in order to find specific books (title).
This application can easily serve as a front end to a Dr. Seuss, dedicated page of a book-store’s website.
